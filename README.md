This project is based on the Lapo Luchini asn1js parser [JavaScript generic ASN.1 parser](https://github.com/lapo-luchini/asn1js).

The purpose is to reuse this good x509 parser to use it with React component.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
